                    Since forever, I've have had love for all things technology.
                    From coding to finance and even the captivating world of
                    blockchain, I just can't get enough! I also love the

                    My first gig was a six-month stint at Accenture as an
                    Associate Software Engineer. But destiny had something
                    exciting in store for me. Soon enough, I stumbled upon an
                    opportunity to work as a web developer intern at Parcel
                    Tech, a Web3 startup based in the US. Starting as an intern,
                    I poured my heart and soul into my work, and my dedication
                    paid off big time! I got promoted to the position of senior
                    full-stack engineer in less than two years. üöÄüë®‚Äçüíª
